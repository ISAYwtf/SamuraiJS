It is study project implemented as social network, created on ReactJS.

If you have any questions for me, you can send me *[email](iaydynov1998@gmail.com)*.

## Deployed project you can find *[here](https://isaywtf.github.io/SamuraiJS/)*

*To sign in to the social network you can use below data:*

#### Login `free@samuraijs.com`

#### Password `free`

## All users in the project are real.

Actually ~~posts~~, ~~messages~~, ~~news~~, ~~music~~, ~~settings~~ and ~~friends~~ are fake.

But you can **follow** someone and **view** their profile.

*In the future, users will be able to write messages to each other.*
